== Introduction

`cib` is a C++ header-only library for building embedded firmware with reusable
components. It implements the compile-time initialization and build pattern.
Instead of initializing components and registering callbacks at runtime, this
process is executed at compile-time using constexpr or consteval functions.

This documentation is a work in progress. See also the
https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/blob/main/README.md[`README`]
file for information.

=== Compiler and C++ version support

The following compilers are supported:

* clang 14 thru 17
* GCC 12 thru 13

C++20 is required.

An older version of `cib` (not covered by this documentation) that uses C++17 is
tagged at https://github.com/intel/compile-time-init-build/tree/v1.7.0[v1.7.0].
It is tested with:

* clang 9 thru 15
* GCC 9 thru 12
